# Uncomfortable Question 002

## Question

> **_What is the difference between a software architect, software engineer, software developer, and where you fit in?_**

## Introduction

This series has the goal to generate thought-provoking content. The intention is not to provide a correct/incorrect approach or point of view, but rather to offer an uncomfortable question so you need to really go deep in your mind to understand why you are making some decisions, and which are the motivations behind them.

Another goal is to share knowledge, personal experiences, and discoveries, as well as receiving them from the community, with the aim to generate a healthy space for discussion about the questions presented.

## Context about the question

Currently, I'm deeply interested in topics like design patterns, software architecture, and clean code in general, so it became clear to me the difference between the skills needed for different roles in a company that builds software products.

With this in mind, I was trying to figure out the real difference between such positions, implying what we should expect for each one.

## My personal answer to the question

After some search between visions about definitions on the title of software architect, software engineer,
and software developer, combined with the definitions of the civil engineer and architect, I came to the
following conclusion (not definitive, though) about such careers:

> Obs: if you have a different view, let's discuss and update the list together!

### Software Developer

-   Analogous to the role of the bricklayer and other professionals who work in the construction of the house, in this case, in the construction of the software.
-   Responsible for implementing the project developed by the software engineer, and ideally, the software developer should be supervised by the engineer.
-   Do not need to be aware of the whole (big picture).
-   Do not need to set standards/patterns, just follow them. However, over time, one can develop an intuition of how to design, but it is a knowledge that comes through practice/repetition, trial and error, and not through conscious effort/study to master design patterns and why to apply each one at your specific time.
-   Do not need to have the conceptual baggage necessary to design systems dimensioned specifically for business requirements, and resize the project if requirements change.
-   Do not need to have the knowledge to choose the trade-offs in relation to project decisions in order to optimally meet business requirements.
-   Must have a good knowledge of the tools: programming languages, frameworks, libraries, version control system (git).
-   Nice to have some knowledge about programming paradigms and design patterns.

### Software Engineer

-   A person who has command of how to design, structure, and scale the software to meet business requirements, according to its present and future needs.
-   Must have knowledge of software patterns.
-   Must know how-to guide and supervise the work of the developers so the construction of the software is aligned with the project patterns previously established.
-   To supervise the team, it is necessary to have a good understanding of software development processes and methodologies.
-   Must be able to generate the software blueprint, which will then be executed by the developers, under their supervision so that everything is being built according to the projected.
-   Must know how to choose the right tool at the right moment, without using limited solutions for complex requirements, and complex solutions for simple requirements.
-   Must be able to deliver maximum value with minimal resources.
-   Must know how to intervene in the execution of the project if it is being done in a way that does not match what was initially planned.
-   Must be able to adapt the project as far as possible if the requirements have been changed.
-   Must have a full understanding of the impact of each choice on the project.
-   Big difference from other fields in Engineering: must also be at least a good developer.

### Software Architect

Considering the subjects studied and the acting of the civil engineer and architect, we can see that the architect has an approach more linked to the artistic, subjective, and human aspects of construction, while the engineer is more concerned with the structural, objective, and managerial aspect of the project.

Thus, in the process of building a software product, the professional involved in such process that most resembles the characteristics of a civil construction architect, in reality, is the Product Designer (UX/UI Designer), a professional with skills in understanding and designing the user experience (human aspect) and with the ability to take care of the appearance of the product (artistic aspect), in order to reflect the business intention and express the idea of the company/product (subjective aspect).

Therefore, I don't think the title Software Architect is necessary/correct since the software (code) is not something artistic/subjective, but rather an objective construction derived from concepts from Computer Science, combined with standards and processes developed and studied in Software Engineering, applied through tools like programming languages, frameworks, libraries, etc.

### Example of a basic flow of building software and people involved

1. Product Owner speaks to Product Designer.
1. Product Designer does research with customers.
1. Product Designer makes the prototype.
1. Product Owner and Software Engineer make notes regarding the prototype.
1. Product Designer remakes prototype based on suggestions.
1. With an approved prototype, Product Designer makes the final version of the screens.
1. Software Engineer makes the blueprint based on the requirements of the system.
1. Software Engineer passes to the Product Owner the necessary steps and estimates for the execution of the project, considering incremental deliveries, according to agile principles.
1. With an approved blueprint, Software Engineer develops initial modules and defines the project standards.
1. With the initial software structure created, Software Developers begin to work on the project, under the supervision of the Software Engineer.
1. Deliveries start to happen, incrementally, with the aim of delivering maximum value in the shortest possible time, always guaranteeing the quality of delivery.
